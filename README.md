# Hackathon Challenge 04: Decentralized AI Training and Automated Prompt Engineering

## Challenge 3:  Automated Prompt Engineering Challenge:

- Develop a genetic algorithm capable of generating prompts for a large language model (LLM) that will yield desired outputs.

- Select a pre-trained open-source LLM and clearly define both the task you want it to perform and the desired outputs for that task.

- Define the components of your genetic algorithm:
    - the space of chromosomes as the potential solutions (prompts);

    - the structure of genes forming the components of a prompt (e.g., keywords, sentences); and

    - the fitness function that evaluates how close the output of the LLM is to the desired output for a given prompt.

- Ensure that the fitness function is computable in a way that automatic evaluation of the fitness of prompts can be performed by integrating the LLM with your genetic algorithm.

- Design effective crossover and mutation algorithms.

- Optimize the structure and parameters of your genetic algorithm in a test environment of your choosing.

- Integrate your solution into HyperCycleâ€™s Computation Node software.
